//You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST),
//where the values of exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake.
//Recover the tree without changing its structure.

//Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
// Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
// Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
